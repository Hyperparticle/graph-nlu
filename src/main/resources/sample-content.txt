Last night, Adly Mansour, the interim leader of Egypt, announced plans to
reform Egypt's constitution and hold a new round of parliamentary and
presidential elections. The interim president also announced a judicial
investigation into yesterday's shooting of at least 51 supporters of deposed
president Mohamed Morsi.

Mansour plans to form a panel within fifteen days to review and suggest changes
to the now-suspended constitution. Those amendments would be voted on in a
referendum within four months. Parliamentary elections would then be held,
perhaps in early 2014, followed by presidential elections upon the forming
of a new parliament.""
